              <h4>Project information</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Category</strong>: Web design</li>
                <li><strong>Client</strong>: NZ Uniforms</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>In November 2019, I embarked on a summer job at NZ Uniforms, primarily engaged in retail operations and
                customer service assistance. My background in Interactive Design Fundamentals sparked a passion for user
                experience (UX) design, prompting me to scrutinise NZ Uniforms' website critically. I observed that
                users frequently encountered navigation difficulties, leading to an overload of inquiries in the
                customer service chat. Determined to address these issues, I proposed a redesign initiative to alleviate
                the burden on the customer service team. </p>
              <h4>Identifying Challenges</h4>
              <p> Through hands-on interaction with the NZ Uniforms website, I identified common user queries revolving
                around product availability, service inquiries, and navigation challenges. Conversations with existing
                employees revealed that many resorted to bookmarking specific pages for easy access, highlighting
                systemic UX issues. </p>
              <h4>Proposed Solutions</h4>
              <p> I initiated discussions with the customer service team and upper management to outline the website's
                pain points and potential improvements. Collaboratively, we formulated a list of requirements,
                including:
              <p> - Streamlining the navigation bar for clarity and relevance <br> - Showcasing key product categories
                prominently <br> - Enhancing the search functionality for better product discovery <br> - Facilitating
                easy access to school or club uniform hubs <br> - Providing visible prompts for user sign-in and support
                services <br> - Retaining essential homepage elements while removing intrusive pop-ups </p>
              <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
              <p> Based on the outlined requirements, I crafted wireframe prototypes for initial feedback. Engaging
                stakeholders across departments, including customer service, retail, and sales representatives, I
                iteratively refined the designs based on their input. Through multiple iterations, we converged on a
                final design that addressed usability concerns and aligned with business objectives. </p>
              <h4>Implementation and Impact</h4>
              <p>After three weeks of iterative design and feedback cycles, the finalised design was implemented with
                the assistance of native software. Post-implementation analysis revealed a significant reduction in
                customer service chat overload, indicating improved user satisfaction and navigation ease. Customer
                Service received 80% less chat requesting assistance to find specific products and services. </p>
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p> My tenure at NZ Uniforms underscored the transformative power of user-centred design. By proactively
                identifying and addressing UX challenges, I spearheaded a redesign initiative that not only enhanced
                user experience but also alleviated operational burdens. This experience reaffirmed my commitment to UX
                design and its pivotal role in driving business success through user-centric solutions. </p>
              <h4>My Learnings</h4>
              <p>If I were to undertake this project again, I would opt to utilise tools like Figma to streamline the
                design process and enhance collaboration. Figma offers a range of features that would have significantly
                expedited various stages of the project, from initial wireframing to iterative design refinement. By
                leveraging Figma's cloud-based platform, I could have easily shared and collaborated on design concepts
                with stakeholders in real-time, facilitating quicker feedback loops and decision-making. Additionally,
                Figma's robust prototyping capabilities would have allowed for more interactive and visually rich
                prototypes, enabling stakeholders to better visualise the proposed design changes and provide more
                informed feedback. Overall, incorporating Figma into the project workflow would have saved valuable time
                by accelerating communication, iteration, and ultimately, the implementation of the redesigned website.
